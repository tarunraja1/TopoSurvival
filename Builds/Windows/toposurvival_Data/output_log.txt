Be careful we don't want you to launch too close to the trap or too far.

Also we should remember what position we launched in so that we can use it to pull the rock.
 
(Filename: C:/BuildAgent/work/d63dfc6385190b60/artifacts/StandalonePlayerGenerated/UnityEngineDebug.cpp Line: 49)

Right. The ground looks a little weak under the trap. 
 
(Filename: C:/BuildAgent/work/d63dfc6385190b60/artifacts/StandalonePlayerGenerated/UnityEngineDebug.cpp Line: 49)

Standing in the wrong position could cause us to pull the rock with too much force and break the ground.

That went well. Now lets stand in the same position we launched in to pull the rock.
 
(Filename: C:/BuildAgent/work/d63dfc6385190b60/artifacts/StandalonePlayerGenerated/UnityEngineDebug.cpp Line: 49)

Ok.

Oh no. We broke the ground.

Perfect. Now we have to waste time getting me in and out. Let's Hurry.
